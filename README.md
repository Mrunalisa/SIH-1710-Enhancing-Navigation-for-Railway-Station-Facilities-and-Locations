# SIH-1710-Enhancing-Navigation-for-Railway-Station-Facilities-and-Locations

Overview
This project aims to revolutionize indoor navigation at railway stations using Augmented Reality (AR) and real-time pathfinding. By leveraging ARCore, users can navigate large, unfamiliar station premises with AR overlays guiding them to their destination.

Key Features
✅ AR-Based Indoor Mapping – Uses Google ARCore to scan and tag key locations.
✅ Real-Time Navigation – Overlays AR directional arrows for intuitive guidance.
✅ Dynamic Indoor Mapping – Captures railway station layouts dynamically (no preloaded blueprints required).
✅ A Pathfinding Algorithm* – Computes the shortest route efficiently.
✅ Firebase Database – Stores indoor maps, locations, and user data.
✅ User-Friendly UI/UX – Designed using Figma for an intuitive experience.
